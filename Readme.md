# How to specify a TabbedGroup's header  minimum size

<p>When developing touch screen applications, usually an application's elements should have a large size.<br />
In newer versions of our components, Touch UI functionality is supported out-of-the-box. Use the <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraEditors.WindowsFormsSettings.TouchUIMode">TouchUIMode</a> property to enable it.

You can also specify the Tab Header size at the skin level. For this, create a custom skin using our <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/SkinEditor/1630/WinForms-Skin-Editor">Skin Editor</a> tool, find the TAB->Tab Header->Tab Header skin element and specify the Size->MinSize property in the Property Grid located on the right side.
